# Description

This project is used to audibly debug [tuna.js](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna). All effects are bypassed by default - just untick the bypass checkbox to enable each effect.

Run ```npm install express``` to use the included local server. Run ```npm start``` to start it and then navigate to http://localhost:8000 to run the app.

Silly main_loop.wav by yours truly.
