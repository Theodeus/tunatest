# Description

This project is used to audibly debug [tuna.js](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna). All effects are bypassed by default - just untick the bypass checkbox to enable each effect.

Run ```npm install express``` to use the included local server. Run ```node server.js``` to start it and then navigate to http://localhost:8000 to run the app.

The server is setup to have the [tuna](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna) folder and the tunatest folder on the same level (as in Tuna is referenced as such: ```<script src="../tuna/tuna.js"></script>```). 

Silly main_loop.wav by yours truly.
